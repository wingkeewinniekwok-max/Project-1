# Project Background
#### The company is a mid-sized retail bank offering everyday financial products such as current accounts, savings accounts, credit cards, and personal loans to consumers across multiple countries. As part of its routine customer management processes, the bank collects detailed information on customer demographics, financial behavior, product usage, credit characteristics, and whether a customer eventually closes their account.
#### This project analyzes that customer-level data to understand the patterns and drivers behind customer churn (account closure) and builds evidence-based insights to help the bank reduce attrition. The analysis will focus on identifying key risk segments, diagnosing the underlying reasons customers leave, and generating targeted recommendations to improve customer retention.
#### The insights and recommendations will center on three key areas:
#### - Customer Engagement — identifying inactive or low-interaction customers who may require proactive outreach.
#### - High-Risk Segments — pinpointing demographic or geographic groups with disproportionate churn rates to guide targeted retention programs.
#### - Financial & Product Behavior — understanding how factors like balance levels, number of products, and credit activity relate to churn to inform cross-sell and loyalty strategies.
